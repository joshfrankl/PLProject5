Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . start
    (1) start -> . code
    (2) code -> . CODE

    CODE            shift and go to state 3

    start                          shift and go to state 1
    code                           shift and go to state 2

state 1

    (0) S' -> start .



state 2

    (1) start -> code .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (start -> code .)


state 3

    (2) code -> CODE .

    $end            reduce using rule 2 (code -> CODE .)
