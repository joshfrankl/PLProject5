Rule 0     S' -> start
Rule 1     start -> line
Rule 2     line -> IP - - DATE TIME COMMAND CODE

Terminals, with rules where they appear

-                    : 2 2
CODE                 : 2
COMMAND              : 2
DATE                 : 2
IP                   : 2
TIME                 : 2
error                :

start                : 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . start
    (1) start -> . line
    (2) line -> . IP - - DATE TIME COMMAND CODE

    IP              shift and go to state 1

    start                          shift and go to state 2
    line                           shift and go to state 3

state 1

    (2) line -> IP . - - DATE TIME COMMAND CODE

    -               shift and go to state 4


state 2

    (0) S' -> start .



state 3

    (1) start -> line .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (start -> line .)


state 4

    (2) line -> IP - . - DATE TIME COMMAND CODE

    -               shift and go to state 5


state 5

    (2) line -> IP - - . DATE TIME COMMAND CODE

    DATE            shift and go to state 6


state 6

    (2) line -> IP - - DATE . TIME COMMAND CODE

    TIME            shift and go to state 7


state 7

    (2) line -> IP - - DATE TIME . COMMAND CODE

    COMMAND         shift and go to state 8


state 8

    (2) line -> IP - - DATE TIME COMMAND . CODE

    CODE            shift and go to state 9


state 9

    (2) line -> IP - - DATE TIME COMMAND CODE .

    $end            reduce using rule 2 (line -> IP - - DATE TIME COMMAND CODE .)
